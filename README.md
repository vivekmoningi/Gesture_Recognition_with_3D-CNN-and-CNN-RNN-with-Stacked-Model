# Gesture_Recognition_with_3D-CNN-and-CNN-RNN-with-Stacked-Model

Gesture Recognition as the name suggests is to control tv based on gestures.The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie

### Understanding Data
The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use.

### Approach for building models

For analysing videos using neural networks, two types of architectures are used commonly. One is the standard CNN + RNN architecture in which you pass the images of a video through a CNN which extracts a feature vector for each image, and then pass the sequence of these feature vectors through an RNN. This is something you are already familiar with (in theory). 

The other popular architecture used to process videos is a natural extension of CNNs - a 3D convolutional network. In this project, you will try both these architectures. Let's have professor Raghavan explain these two approaches.

##### Convolutions + RNN
The conv2D network will extract a feature vector for each image, and a sequence of these feature vectors is then fed to an RNN-based network. The output of the RNN is a regular softmax (for a classification problem such as this one).

##### 3D Convolutional Network
3D convolutions are a natural extension to the 2D convolutions you are already familiar with. Just like in 2D conv, you move the filter in two directions (x and y), in 3D conv, you move the filter in three directions (x, y and z).
